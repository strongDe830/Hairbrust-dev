            "text": "<p>In males, DHT is crucial for male characteristics during fetal growth and triggers changes during puberty like facial and body hair growth and voice deepening. In females, it exists in much lower levels and helps regulate hormone balance and support sexual health.</p><p>However, DHT is also one of the key hormones involved in hair loss, particularly in a condition called <strong>androgenetic alopecia, </strong>also known as male-pattern or female pattern hair loss.</p><p>When too much testosterone is converted into DHT, it can begin to affect the hair follicles on the scalp, especially in people who are more sensitive to it. DHT binds to androgen receptors in the follicles and can trigger a process called<strong> follicular miniaturisation</strong>. This is where the follicles gradually shrink, particularly in areas like the temples, crown, and mid-scalp, which causes hair to grow back thinner, shorter, and weaker with each cycle. Over time, the follicles can become so small that they no longer produce visible hair. DHT also <strong>shortens the anagen (growth) phase, </strong>causing hair to fall out sooner, and <strong>increases the telogen (resting) phase</strong>, so more hairs remain in the shedding stage, leading to noticeable thinning. <strong>However, not everyone responds to DHT the same way and your genetics play a major role in how sensitive your hair follicles are to its effects.</strong> </p><p>Because of this, we have prioritised including trademarked ingredients within our scalp treatments that have shown to imitate testosterone so that less DHT is converted, as well as slow down the production of enzyme 5-alpha-reductase to also reduce the conversion of DHT. This helps to reduce thinning, hair loss etc. Together, this helps minimise hair thinning, reduce shedding, and support healthier, fuller-looking hair.</p>",

Beyond support, it plays a crucial role in maintaining <strong>vascularisation</strong> by helping to form and stabilise the blood vessels that deliver oxygen and nutrients to the hair follicle. Without this steady supply, hair growth can slow down or weaken, making a healthy ECM essential for strong, thriving hair.</p><p>While everyone has an ECM, its composition and function can vary based on individual factors like age, genetics, and overall health. its quality and function decline with age or due to stress, inflammation, or hormonal factors (like DHT).</p><p>Changes in the ECM can contribute to hair loss. For example, the ECM may become damaged or altered due to aging, stress, nutritional deficiencies etc. which can affect hair growth and lead to thinning or loss of hair.
